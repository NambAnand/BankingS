# BankingS
/**Hi myself Nambiar Anand Sreenivasan (230003046) from mechanical engineering.
I have tried my best to imitate it as working ATM Machine, where you can enter you custom account number
and can perform all basic banking functions, like withdrawing, depositing, calculating interest, transacting money
to different account and so on.
I have extensively used file handling algorithms which make my program even special because datas arent lost even if u exit the system, and you can
get the same data and values even when u restart the system. */
